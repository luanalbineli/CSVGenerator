# CSVGenerator
## This is a simple C# CSV generator that i've made to a project, and i resolve to make this code public.
<br>
# Usage: <br>
* Clone this project.
* There's a simple Winforms application using the two main files: CSVGenerator and CSVColumnAttribute. They do all the "hard" work.
* Simple pass a type to the CSVGenerator and a list of objects of that type to the WriteContent method and voil√†.
* If u want to print a filter before the data (not common, but anyway), you can use the WriteHeader method, passing a type and a single object of that type.
* All the presentation and format of values you do in the model, using the attribute CSVColumn. You can threat:
* * Header column text.
* * Format of the column.
* * Value if the field is null.
* * Order (of columns).
* * New line after print (column, used when you need to append a new line after print the filter value).

* Enclosure the CSVGenerator instance object in a using statement, to "automagic" dispose the object.
